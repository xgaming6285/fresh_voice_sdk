# Voice Agent Streaming Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Audio Response Handling**: The agent was not properly handling Gemini's streaming audio responses. The warnings about "non-text parts" indicated that audio was being returned but not processed correctly.

2. **RTP Packet Size**: The agent was sending extremely large RTP packets (16KB+), which is incorrect. Standard RTP packets for telephony should be 160 bytes (20ms of Î¼-law audio at 8kHz).

3. **Initial Greeting**: Enhanced the initial greeting trigger by sending 500ms of silence and an explicit text prompt.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Continuous Response Receiver

- Now properly handles `server_content.model_turn.parts` structure where Gemini sends audio
- Handles both base64-encoded and raw bytes audio data
- Processes audio immediately as it arrives for low latency
- Properly handles inline_data with mime_type checking

### 2. Fixed RTP Packet Transmission

- Split large audio buffers into standard 160-byte RTP packets
- Each packet represents 20ms of Î¼-law audio at 8kHz
- This matches telephony standards and what Gate VoIP expects

### 3. Improved Session Initialization

- Increased initial silence duration to 500ms
- Added explicit text prompt to ensure greeting
- Better error handling for connection issues

## How It Works Now

1. **Call Setup**: When a call comes in, the agent creates a voice session and RTP session
2. **Audio Input**: Incoming audio is queued and sent to Gemini in chunks
3. **Streaming Response**: A separate task continuously receives responses from Gemini
4. **Audio Output**: As audio arrives from Gemini, it's immediately:
   - Converted from 24kHz to 8kHz
   - Encoded to Î¼-law format
   - Split into 160-byte packets
   - Sent via RTP to the caller

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Call the agent
2. You should hear the greeting: "Hello, how can I help you today?"
3. Speak to the agent - you should hear responses
4. Check logs for:
   - "ðŸ“¥ Received X bytes of audio from Gemini"
   - "ðŸ“¡ Sent RTP audio packet" with ~172 byte packets (160 payload + 12 header)

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't hear audio:

1. Check firewall - ensure UDP port 5004 is open for RTP
2. Verify Gate VoIP codec settings - should support PCMU (Î¼-law)
3. Check logs for any error messages about audio processing
4. Ensure your Gemini API key has access to voice features
