# Summary Generation Fix

## Issue

When trying to generate summaries for call sessions, the system was returning 404 errors:

```
GET /api/transcripts/{session_id}/summary HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
```

The underlying error was:

```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```

## Root Cause

The `summary/file_summarizer.py` script requires the `google-generativeai` package (the legacy Google Gemini SDK), but it was not installed in the virtual environment.

The `requirements.txt` file only had `google-genai>=0.2.0` (the new SDK for Gemini Live API), which is a different package used by the main voice agent.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `requirements.txt`

Added the missing package:

```txt
# Google AI / Gemini Live API
google-genai>=0.2.0
# Google Generative AI (for summary generation)
google-generativeai>=0.8.0
```

### 2. Installed the Package

Ran:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai>=0.8.0
```

Successfully installed:

- `google-generativeai-0.8.5`
- `google-ai-generativelanguage-0.6.15`
- `google-api-core-2.28.0`
- `google-api-python-client-2.185.0`
- And all required dependencies

## What the Summary Feature Does

The `file_summarizer.py` script:

1. Reads transcript files (incoming, outgoing, mixed audio)
2. Sends them to Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model)
3. Analyzes the conversation
4. Returns:
   - **Summary**: Comprehensive analysis of the call (purpose, topics, outcomes)
   - **Status**: Customer interest level (`interested` or `not interested`)

## How It Works in the CRM

1. User makes a call → Transcripts are generated
2. User clicks "Generate Summary" in the Sessions detail view
3. Backend runs: `python summary/file_summarizer.py --language Bulgarian [transcript files]`
4. Summary is saved to MongoDB and displayed in the UI

## Environment Variable Required

Make sure you have this in your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY_SUMMARY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

This is the API key used specifically for summary generation (can be the same as your main Gemini key).

## Testing

Try generating a summary now:

1. Go to Sessions page
2. Click on any completed session
3. Click "Generate Summary" button
4. Should see the summary appear after a few seconds

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Summary generation should now work correctly!
