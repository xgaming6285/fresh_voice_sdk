# 🎉 **RTP Address Mapping - FINAL FIX**

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

From your latest logs, the issue was **RTP address mismatch**:

```
🎵 Created RTP session for ('192.168.50.50', 5060)  ← SIP signaling port
⚠️ Received RTP audio from ('192.168.50.50', 137708) ← Actual RTP port
```

**The Problem:** SIP signaling uses port 5060, but RTP media uses port 137708. Your agent was only listening for RTP from the SIP port, so all audio was marked as "unknown address" and **ignored**.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied**

### **Smart RTP Address Matching**

- **Before:** Exact address match required `('192.168.50.50', 5060)`
- **After:** IP-based matching with automatic port update

```python
# Match by IP address only (port can be different for RTP vs SIP)
if rtp_session.remote_addr[0] == addr[0]:
    # Update the RTP session's actual RTP address if it changed
    if rtp_session.remote_addr != addr:
        logger.info(f"📍 Updating RTP address from {rtp_session.remote_addr} to {addr}")
        rtp_session.remote_addr = addr

    rtp_session.process_incoming_audio(audio_payload, payload_type, timestamp)
```

## 🚀 **Test the Final Fix**

### **1. Restart the Agent:**

```bash
python windows_voice_agent.py --port 8001
```

### **2. Expected NEW Behavior:**

```
📞 Incoming call from +359988925337
🎵 Created RTP session for ('192.168.50.50', 5060)
🎵 Received RTP audio from ('192.168.50.50', 137708): 160 bytes, PT=0
📍 Updating RTP address from ('192.168.50.50', 5060) to ('192.168.50.50', 137708)
🎤 Queued 320 bytes of PCM audio for processing
🎙️ Processing audio chunk: 320 bytes → Gemini: 640 bytes
📥 Received audio response from Gemini: 1024 bytes
🔊 Converted to telephony format: 512 bytes - sending back via RTP
📡 Sent RTP audio packet to ('192.168.50.50', 137708): 172 bytes
```

### **3. What Should Work Now:**

1. **Call connects** ✅ (already working)
2. **RTP address automatically updates** to actual media port ✅
3. **Your voice is processed** by Gemini ✅
4. **AI responds with audio** sent back to Asterisk ✅
5. **You hear the AI talking back** ✅
6. **Two-way conversation works** ✅

## 🎯 **Expected Call Flow**

1. **You call** → Agent answers immediately
2. **You speak** → Logs show audio processing
3. **AI processes** → Gemini live session responds
4. **You hear AI response** → Two-way conversation!

## 🔧 **If Still No AI Audio**

Check for these log messages:

- ✅ **`📍 Updating RTP address`** - RTP addressing is fixed
- ✅ **`🎤 Queued X bytes`** - Your audio is being processed
- ✅ **`📥 Received audio response from Gemini`** - AI is responding
- ✅ **`📡 Sent RTP audio packet`** - Audio sent back to caller

## 🎤 **The Complete Audio Chain Should Now Work**

**Your Voice** → **Asterisk** → **Voice Agent** → **Gemini** → **Voice Agent** → **Asterisk** → **Your Phone**

The RTP address mapping fix should resolve the "unknown address" issue and allow the complete audio processing chain to function properly!
