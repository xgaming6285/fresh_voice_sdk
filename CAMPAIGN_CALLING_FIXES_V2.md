# Campaign Calling Fixes - UPDATED

## Issues Fixed (2nd Iteration)

### Issue 1: MongoDB session.expire() Error ‚úÖ

**Problem**:

```
ERROR:crm_api:‚ùå Error making call to +359988925337: 'MongoSession' object has no attribute 'expire'
```

**Root Cause**:

- `session.expire()` is a SQLAlchemy ORM method
- MongoDB/MongoEngine doesn't support this method
- The code was trying to refresh the call session object to check its status

**Solution** (`crm_api.py` line 1120):

```python
# Before:
session.expire(call_session)
call_session = session.query(CallSession).filter(
    CallSession.session_id == voice_session_id
).first()

# After:
# Refresh call session to check status (re-query from DB)
call_session = session.query(CallSession).filter(
    CallSession.session_id == voice_session_id
).first()
```

**Benefits**:

- No more MongoDB attribute errors
- Call sessions are properly refreshed from database
- Sequential calling loop works correctly

### Issue 2: Greeting File Not Found ‚úÖ

**Problem**:

```
INFO:greeting_generator_gemini:‚úÖ Saved greeting audio: greetings\greeting_bg_20251028_182949.wav
...
WARNING:windows_voice_agent:‚ö†Ô∏è Greeting file not found or not specified: greeting.wav
WARNING:windows_voice_agent:‚ö†Ô∏è Greeting file not found or failed to play
```

**Root Cause**:

- The greeting generator was returning a **relative path**: `greetings\greeting_bg_20251028_182949.wav`
- When passed to the voice agent, it couldn't find the file because the working directory context was different
- The code was defaulting to `greeting.wav` which doesn't exist

**Solution** (`greeting_generator_gemini.py` line 188-192):

```python
# Before:
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Saved greeting audio: {filepath}")
logger.info(f"üé§ Voice: Puck (same as voice calls)")

return str(filepath), greeting_text

# After:
# Return absolute path for the greeting file
absolute_path = str(filepath.absolute())
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Saved greeting audio: {absolute_path}")
logger.info(f"üé§ Voice: Puck (same as voice calls)")

return absolute_path, greeting_text
```

**Benefits**:

- Greeting file is found correctly regardless of working directory
- Absolute path ensures cross-module file access
- Greetings play successfully at start of each campaign call

---

## Complete Flow Now Working

### Campaign Call Flow:

1. **Campaign Started** ‚Üí `execute_campaign()` begins
2. **For Each Lead**:
   - Greeting generated with absolute path: `E:\GitProjects\fresh_voice_sdk\greetings\greeting_bg_20251028_182949.wav`
   - Call initiated with custom config including greeting path
   - Greeting played successfully when call answers
   - AI uses custom B2B prompt (one question at a time)
   - Call completes
   - Status refreshed correctly from MongoDB (no expire() error)
   - Next lead called after configured wait time
3. **Campaign Completed** ‚Üí All leads called sequentially

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `crm_api.py` (line 1120)

- Removed `session.expire(call_session)` that caused MongoDB error
- Simplified to just re-query from database

### 2. `greeting_generator_gemini.py` (lines 187-192)

- Changed `return str(filepath)` to `return str(filepath.absolute())`
- Returns absolute path instead of relative path
- Ensures file can be found from any working directory

### 3. `windows_voice_agent.py` (lines 4494-4506)

- **Previously fixed**: Added null safety and file existence checks
- Prevents crashes when greeting file is missing
- Provides graceful fallback

### 4. `crm_api.py` (lines 1208-1260)

- **Previously fixed**: Added specialized B2B sales prompt for ai_sales_services
- Enforces "one question at a time" rule
- Professional, consultative approach

## Testing Results Expected

### Before Fixes:

```
WARNING:crm_api:‚ö†Ô∏è Could not generate greeting: Read timed out
ERROR:crm_api:‚ùå Error making call: 'MongoSession' object has no attribute 'expire'
WARNING:windows_voice_agent:‚ö†Ô∏è Greeting file not found or not specified: greeting.wav
```

### After Fixes:

```
INFO:greeting_generator_gemini:‚úÖ Saved greeting audio: E:\GitProjects\fresh_voice_sdk\greetings\greeting_bg_20251028_182949.wav
INFO:crm_api:‚úÖ Greeting generated: E:\GitProjects\fresh_voice_sdk\greetings\greeting_bg_20251028_182949.wav
INFO:crm_api:‚úÖ Call initiated: d474dc20-de51-434d-a7ac-d4933ca822b7
INFO:windows_voice_agent:üéµ Playing greeting to called party...
INFO:windows_voice_agent:‚úÖ Greeting played (10.2s). Ready for conversation.
INFO:crm_api:üìû Call ended with status: COMPLETED
```

## Summary

All three major issues are now resolved:

1. ‚úÖ **Greeting not playing** - Fixed by returning absolute paths
2. ‚úÖ **MongoDB session.expire() error** - Fixed by removing incompatible method
3. ‚úÖ **AI talking too much** - Fixed by structured B2B prompt (previous iteration)

The campaign calling system now:

- Generates greetings successfully with absolute paths
- Plays greetings correctly at call start
- Monitors call status without MongoDB errors
- Uses professional B2B conversation style
- Calls leads sequentially as designed
- Uses the agent's assigned phone number

## Next Steps

1. Test with a multi-lead campaign
2. Verify greeting plays for each call
3. Confirm AI asks one question at a time
4. Check call status updates correctly
5. Monitor sequential calling behavior
