# Voice Agent Connection Issues - Analysis and Fixes

## üîç Issues Identified

Based on the logs from your call attempt, I identified several critical issues preventing the voice agent from working properly:

### 1. **IP Address Mismatch** ‚ùå

**Problem:** Asterisk (192.168.50.50) is trying to contact the voice agent at `sip:voice-agent@192.168.2.50:5060`, but your agent is actually listening on `192.168.50.128:5060`.

**Evidence from logs:**

```
Retransmitting #4 (no NAT) to 192.168.50.128:5060:
OPTIONS sip:voice-agent@192.168.2.50:5060 SIP/2.0
```

**Impact:** This causes all SIP communication to fail after the initial INVITE.

### 2. **Async Context Issues** ‚ùå

**Problem:** The RTP audio processing was trying to create asyncio tasks from non-async contexts, causing the audio processing to fail.

**Evidence:** Voice session connected successfully but no audio was processed.

**Impact:** Even when calls connect, no audio flows in either direction.

### 3. **Premature Agent Shutdown** ‚ùå

**Problem:** The agent was manually stopped (CTRL+C) during the call, breaking the connection.

**Evidence from logs:**

```
INFO:     Shutting down
ERROR:windows_voice_agent:Error in SIP listener: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket
```

**Impact:** Active calls are terminated abruptly.

### 4. **Missing Proper Call Cleanup** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** When calls end naturally (BYE messages), the cleanup had async context issues.

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Async Audio Processing**

- **What:** Modified `_process_audio_queue()` to handle asyncio contexts properly
- **How:** Added proper event loop management for threading contexts
- **Result:** Audio processing will now work correctly

```python
# Before: asyncio.create_task(self._process_chunk(chunk_to_process))
# After: Proper loop handling with timeout and error handling
```

### 2. **Improved Session Cleanup**

- **What:** Fixed `cleanup()` method to work synchronously
- **How:** Added both sync and async cleanup methods
- **Result:** Calls will end cleanly without hanging

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- **What:** Added comprehensive error handling in audio processing
- **How:** Wrapped all async operations with try-catch blocks
- **Result:** Agent won't crash on audio processing errors

### 4. **Created Debug Tool**

- **What:** New `debug_sip_connection.py` script
- **How:** Comprehensive network and configuration checking
- **Result:** Easy identification of connectivity issues

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. **Fix the IP Address Mismatch**

This is the **most critical issue**. You need to configure your Gate VoIP (Asterisk) to use the correct IP address:

**Option A: Update Asterisk Configuration**

- Access your Gate VoIP admin panel (192.168.50.50)
- Find the SIP trunk configuration
- Change the voice agent IP from `192.168.2.50` to `192.168.50.128`

**Option B: Verify Network Configuration**
Run the debug script to identify all IP issues:

```bash
python debug_sip_connection.py
```

### 2. **Test the Fixed Agent**

```bash
python windows_voice_agent.py --port 8001
```

### 3. **Monitor the Logs**

The agent now has better logging. Watch for:

- ‚úÖ "Voice session connected successfully"
- ‚úÖ "Sending audio chunk" / "Received audio response"
- ‚ùå Any async-related errors (should be fixed now)

### 4. **Test Call Flow**

1. Make a test call
2. Verify the agent answers (180 Ringing, 200 OK)
3. Verify audio flows both directions
4. Test call termination (BYE handling)

## üîß Troubleshooting Tools

### Debug Connection Issues

```bash
python debug_sip_connection.py
```

This will check:

- Network connectivity
- IP address configuration
- Port accessibility
- Voice agent status
- Configuration mismatches

### Monitor SIP Traffic

Use Wireshark or similar to capture SIP traffic on port 5060:

```
Filter: udp.port == 5060
```

### Check Voice Agent Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

## üìä Expected Call Flow (After Fixes)

1. **INVITE** ‚Üí Agent receives call ‚úÖ
2. **180 Ringing** ‚Üí Agent responds ‚úÖ
3. **200 OK** ‚Üí Call answered ‚úÖ
4. **ACK** ‚Üí Acknowledgment received ‚úÖ
5. **RTP Audio** ‚Üí Bidirectional audio flows ‚úÖ (Fixed)
6. **BYE** ‚Üí Call terminated cleanly ‚úÖ (Fixed)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Configuration Check

Verify in `asterisk_config.json`:

```json
{
  "voice_agent_ip": "192.168.50.128",
  "local_ip": "192.168.50.128"
}
```

And make sure your Gate VoIP is configured to route calls to `192.168.50.128:5060`, not `192.168.2.50:5060`.

## üéØ Success Indicators

When working properly, you should see:

1. **Call connects** without IP mismatch errors
2. **Voice session initializes** and stays connected
3. **Audio processing** works in both directions
4. **Calls end gracefully** without socket errors
5. **No async context warnings** in the logs
