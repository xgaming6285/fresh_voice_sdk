# Final Voice Agent Audio Fixes 🔊

## 🎉 **Great Progress!**

Your logs show the major issues are now **RESOLVED**:

### ✅ **What's Working:**

1. **SIP Connection**: Perfect call flow (INVITE → RING → OK → ACK) ✅
2. **Voice Session**: Gemini connects successfully ✅
3. **Call Management**: Proper BYE handling without crashes ✅
4. **Session Logging**: Data saves correctly ✅

### 🔧 **Final Audio Processing Fixes Applied**

I've enhanced the audio processing chain with better logging and debugging:

#### 1. **Enhanced Audio Flow Tracking**

- Added detailed logging for each audio step
- Track incoming RTP packets and processing
- Monitor Gemini audio responses
- Log outbound RTP packet sending

#### 2. **Improved Voice Session Initialization**

- Added automatic greeting on call connect
- Better cleanup handling
- Fixed async context issues

#### 3. **Better RTP Audio Handling**

- Enhanced logging for received audio packets
- Improved error handling in audio processing
- Better payload type detection and conversion

## 🚀 **Test the Enhanced Agent**

### 1. **Start the Agent**

```bash
python windows_voice_agent.py --port 8001
```

### 2. **Make a Test Call**

When you call, watch for these NEW log messages:

#### **Expected Audio Flow:**

1. **Call Connection:**

   ```
   📞 Incoming call from +359988925337
   ✅ Voice session connected successfully
   👋 Sent initial greeting: Hello! I'm your AI voice assistant...
   ```

2. **Incoming Audio Processing:**

   ```
   🎵 Received RTP audio from ('192.168.50.50', 5060): X bytes, PT=0
   🎤 Queued X bytes of PCM audio for processing
   🎙️ Processing audio chunk: X bytes → Gemini: X bytes
   ```

3. **AI Response:**
   ```
   📥 Received audio response from Gemini: X bytes
   🤖 AI Response: [text response from AI]
   🔊 Converted to telephony format: X bytes - sending back via RTP
   📡 Sent RTP audio packet to (IP, PORT): X bytes
   ```

## 🔍 **Debugging the Audio Path**

### **If You Still Don't Hear the AI:**

1. **Check Incoming Audio:**

   - Look for `🎵 Received RTP audio` messages
   - If missing: **RTP audio isn't reaching the agent**

2. **Check AI Processing:**

   - Look for `📥 Received audio response from Gemini` messages
   - If missing: **Audio isn't being processed by Gemini**

3. **Check Outbound Audio:**
   - Look for `📡 Sent RTP audio packet` messages
   - If missing: **Agent isn't sending audio back**

## 🎯 **Most Likely Remaining Issue**

Based on your Asterisk logs showing "Can't send 10 type frames with SIP write", the issue is likely:

### **RTP Port Mismatch**

Your agent advertises RTP port **5004** in SDP, but Asterisk might be sending to a different port.

### **Quick Fix - Check RTP Ports:**

1. **In your Asterisk logs, look for:**

   ```
   Strict RTP learning after remote address set to: 192.168.50.128:XXXX
   ```

2. **If the port isn't 5004, update your agent configuration:**
   ```json
   // In asterisk_config.json - add RTP port config
   "rtp_port": XXXX  // Use the port from Asterisk logs
   ```

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the call with enhanced logging**
2. **Check for the new audio flow messages**
3. **If still no audio, check RTP port alignment**
4. **Verify firewall allows UDP traffic on RTP ports**

## 🎤 **Expected Behavior Now**

When working properly:

1. **Call connects immediately**
2. **AI greets you automatically**: "Hello! I'm your AI voice assistant..."
3. **You speak** → Audio processing logs appear
4. **AI responds** → You hear the response
5. **Two-way conversation works**

The enhanced logging will show you exactly where the audio flow breaks if there are still issues!
